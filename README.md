# Python Project Bootstrap

Python Project Bootstrap is a simple script designed to quickly set up the directory structure and essential files for a new Python project. It aims to streamline the initial setup process, allowing you to focus on writing code rather than spending time on boilerplate setup.

## Features

- Creates a well-structured directory layout
- Initializes the main package and subpackage directories
- Sets up directories for tests, documentation, and scripts
- Generates basic `__init__.py`, module, and test files
- Provides a sample `README.md`
- Includes `requirements.txt`, `setup.py`, `setup.cfg`, `LICENSE`, and `.gitignore` files

## Installation

Clone the repository and run the bootstrap script with your desired project name:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/zfouts/python-project-bootstrap.git
cd python-project-bootstrap
bash bootstrap.sh example
```

## Customization

Feel free to customize the structure and files according to your project's specific needs. The bootstrap script provides a solid foundation for any Python application or library.
